pictures for the readme.

esp32 must be package version 1.0.6, the next one up 2.0.0 and further breaks OmEspHelpers for now 2023

if upload fails for missing python, try:
sed -i -e 's/=python /=python3 /g' ~/Library/Arduino15/packages/esp32/hardware/esp32/*/platform.txt

------
2024 it was just two symbols that broke past 1.0.6
ARDUINO_EVENT_WIFI_AP_STACONNECTED, ARDUINO_EVENT_WIFI_AP_STADISCONNECTED
easy fix

Now I find that esp32 board package 2.0 is earliest with S2 support
and 3.0.2 _seems_ to have a memory leak, visible if I refresh _info page on omesphelpers
2024-06-28. 3 weeks post ginger. sad.
2.0 -- no leak
2.0.17 -- seems no leak
3.0.0
